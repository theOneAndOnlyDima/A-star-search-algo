# A\* path finding algorithm

## Visualization of the a-star path finding algorithm using python

- When program starts, choose the start and end coordinates (must be between (1,1) and (48,48))
  - [Optional]: Click <b>Randomize</b> to generate random coordinates
- Click <b>Submit</b>
- Draw obstacles with left mouse click, erase obstacles with right mouse click
- When ready, press SPACE or ENTER to start the path finding algorithm

## To do when I have time and motivation

Multithreading to draw grid and ask coords simultaneously
